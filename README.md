# CBIR

-Developed a Deep Learning model which retrieves similar images from a database given a query image.
-Done using semantic hashes generated by a deep bottleneck autoencoder.
-Used MobileNetV2 CNN model pretrained over the ImageNet database in accordance with the autoencoder to identify image features, with the autoencoder layers trained over the results of the CNN model as part of the transfer learning approach.

AIM: To develop a web application using FLASK and connect it with the model to perform reverse image search operation.
